# CMU-Deep-Learning-Systems

By the end of this course, you will

- understand the basic functioning of modern deep learning libraries, including
concepts like automatic differentiation, gradient-based optimization
- be able to implement several standard deep learning architectures (MLPs,
ConvNets, RNNs, Transformers), truly from scratch
- understand how hardware acceleration (e.g., on GPUs) works under the hood
for modern deep learning architectures, and be able to develop your own highly
efficient code
